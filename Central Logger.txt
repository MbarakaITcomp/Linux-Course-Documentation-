                                        ### Central Logger ###

Rsyslog is a free and opensource logging utility that exists by default on  CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 systems. 
It provides an easy and effective way of centralizing logs from client nodes to a single central server. 
The centralization of logs is beneficial in two ways. First,  it simplifies viewing of logs as the Systems 
administrator can view all the logs of remote servers from a central point without logging into every client system 
to check the logs. This is greatly beneficial if there are several servers that need to be monitored and secondly, 
in the event that a remote client suffers a crash, you need not worry about losing the logs because all the logs will 
be saved on the central rsyslog server. Rsyslog has replaced syslog which only supported UDP protocol. It extends 
the basic syslog protocol with superior features such as support for both UDP and TCP protocols in transporting logs, 
augmented filtering abilities, and flexible configuration options.
